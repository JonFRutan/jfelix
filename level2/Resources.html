<p>This page is for listing some helpful resources for my peers, and some of my own recommendations.</p>
<h2>Linux</h2>
<p>When I was searching for a Linux distro I had two key things I deemed necessary: Stability and Simplicity.</p>
<p>Personally I like to be able to view my running processes and recognize everything. <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a> was what I was looking for, but a bit intimidating.</p>
<p>So my personal recommendation for a Linux distro is <a href="https://www.salixos.org/">SalixOS</a> which was designed to make Slackware more accessible to newcomers like myself.</p>
