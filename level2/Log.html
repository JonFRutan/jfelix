	<p style="margin-top: 40px;">2024-09-09: I made an account and used the free VM on Oracle Cloud with a minimalist ubuntu and installed nginx. </p>
	<p>2024-09-10: I purchased the cheapest top-level domain (.lol) and propagated my website DNS to the world. The website went up this day. </p>
	<p>2024-09-11: Using certbot I created a certificate to make the connection HTTPS. </p>
	<p>2024-09-12: I synced the server to a GitHub repo so I can update it anywhere, this was accomplished with crontab. </p>
	<p>2024-09-13: Now that the website is up and fully functional, I added several pages and spruced up the design. </p>
	<p>2024-09-15: Beginning the process of setting up the website for compatibility with different devices. </p>
	<p>2024-09-16: Mobile compatibility was worked and and will be postponed for a time. This will be done when I have a basic site layout so I can make sure it works everywhere.</p>
	<p>2024-09-18: <s>Created the Literature page for book and reading stuff.</s> Removed for now.</p>
