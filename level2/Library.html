        <h1>Literature</h1>
	<p>~====================~</p>
    </header>
<p>This page is for literature recommendations, be it books or short stories.</p>
<p>If the literature is public domain or easily accessible, I will try to link it.</p>
<p>I am open to recommendations, in general I prefer to read 'classics'.</p>
<p>Currently Reading: Moby Dick | Reading Queue: Grapes of Wrath, East of Eden, Of Mice and Men</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Books</h2>
<h3>Crime and Punishment - Dostoevsky</h3>
<p>This is a contender for the greatest book I've read. Dostoevsky masterfully displays feelings of turmoil, guilt, loss, all in a beautifully cold and somber setting.</p>
<p>Crime and Punishment is the story of how misery warps the soul of a man into a monster. More importantly though, is Dostoevsky's message of redemption and acceptance, that no person can be too far beyond</p>
<p>The writing can be a bit complex at times, and the Russian naming convention might be confusing at first. Working past these, you'll find a book that touches deep into the spirit and psyche of struggle.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly recommend everyone read this.</p>
<h3>A Farewell to Arms - Hemingway</h3>
<p>This book is rather quick and simple to read. Almost deceptively simple though; as it does have some interesting themes veiled by Hemingway's unique dialogue and rather blunt writing.</p>
<p>I generally enjoyed most of the book, a wartime romance with vividly written scenery. I will mention that the book takes a rather unexpected turn at a certain point, that quite affects the entire story.</p>
<p>I would recommend this book to those who like a straightforward narrative, and can handle serious and dark themes.</p>
<h3>Moby Dick</h3>
<p><i>Currently Reading - about 3/4 through.</i>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">Short Stories</h2>
<h3>The Last Question - Asimov</h3>
<p>Carnegie Mellon hosts this story <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~gamvrosi/thelastq.html">here.</a></p>
<p>A very prescient and foreboding story that holds far more relevancy today than anyone could have expected. I recommend you read it, you'll quickly realize what I am referring to.</p>
